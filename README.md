2D maze game with genetic algorithm

Goal:
The goal of this project was to develop a genetic algorithm in order to solve a maze game without taking it too seriously. In order to play, you have to choose values (modifying the script) for the key parameters such as :
- keyword (define which map to use)
- AGENT_NUMBER (number of agents generated for one generation)
- GENOME_SIZE(the number of directions that an agent will take during one generation)
- GENERATION_NUMBER (number of turns before the game ends)
- KEEPING_RATE (the proportion kept among the agents' sample to generate a new population)
- MUTATION_RATE (the probability to affect one "gene", that is to say, one direction of one agent)
- the score evaluation method (the way to evaluate if an agent is better than another one to solve the maze)

Features:
- 4 maps ("very easy", "easy", "medium" and "hard")
- display of the solving process + ranking
- music 

Comment :
All maps are completable. I personally did it but you may need to change the parameters' values and to hope for the best.

Disclaimer:
I do not own any of the audio. It was composed by Nobuo Uematsu and is part of the video game "Final Fantasy X HD Remaster". There are 3 songs :
- Normal battle theme
- Victory fanfare theme
- Game over theme

I do no get any money out of this, I just found those themes pretty good to illustrate the game. Moreover, it is a way to spread their awesomeness !
